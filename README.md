Welcome! This is the YoutubeSpamKiller program! It automatically detects and erradicates bot comments from youtube comment sections to make the comment section of youtube more friendly
How this program works:
It automatically checks the comments and usernames of comments using the google API and uses pre defined keywords to delete the comments
This program is a tool, so it isn't something that is always running (For now, hoping to make it always running)
The limit is 10,000 comments and replies every day per client secrets file. The limit resets at 12:00 AM at pacific time. (For now, hoping to remove this limit)
This program is in beta, so there are still plenty of changes and bug fixes ahed!
I am looking for help if anyone is intrested in helping develop this program
Before you use the Verification bypass, please make sure you have your browser's webdrivers installed and running and remote automation enabled if you have to
That's all I have to say! Happy bot-terminating!
